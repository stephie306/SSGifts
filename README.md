# SSGifts

*Website that **connects** people*

## Purpose
The idea of this particular website is to enable people to meet and get to know others. 

## How did we get the idea?
When in quarantine, people are really bored and tend to make really strange ideas. Our was to create a website, where people could exchange gifts anonymously. That way you meet new people who potentially will appeal to you. And if not, at least you got a present.

## How does it work?
You make a profile in the website that contains some of your personal info: first name, last name, email, age, address and gender. The fields for age and gender will be optional, but for a better experience are recomended, and the address field is to know where to send the gifts. When you finish your account, you can join events. The events are periodical so if you don't like the current one or are late to join, there will be next one. Every event will have a couple stages.

  **Stage №1 - acquaintance**
  
  In this stage the participants will have 15 days to get to know eachother. This will happen thorugh the website chat interface which will assign 2 other people to you: the one you will gift to and the one that will gift to you. You have the freedom to communicate on every topic, but will be forbidden to share personal info. If we catch someone breaking the rules, he/she will be banned.
  
  **Stage №2 - choosing gifts**
  
  In this stage you'll have to buy present for your reciever. The time limit will be 5 days. Here you should really try to gift a thought out present, because the best present will recieve a prize.
  
  **Stage №3 - sending gifts**
  
  This stage is purely organizational. This will be the time to send out your gift. At that time you will know to whom to send the present, so you can open their profile and check the recieving address. But wait... didn't you say that the gifting will be annonymous? Yes, but you might want to stay in touch with the person you communicated with for the past half month. That's why we'll make the profiles visible, but after stage 2.
  
  **Stage №4 - rating the gifts**
  
  At the end of the event, you'll have the option to rate the gift you recieved. Don't fake the rating - give your honest oppinion, because the best gift of them all will recieve a first place prize.
